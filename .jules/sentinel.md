## 2024-08-05 - Hardcoded Credentials in Login Component
**Vulnerability:** The application contains hardcoded credentials (`kasir`/`1234`) directly within the `LoginPage` component in `src/App.tsx`.
**Learning:** This vulnerability exists because the application uses a mock authentication service for development and demonstration purposes, but the credentials were never properly secured or externalized. The `authService.login` function in `src/services/storage.ts` also lacks any real password validation, making the login process insecure by design.
**Prevention:** To prevent this in the future, all sensitive data, including credentials, must be externalized from the source code and managed through secure environment variables. A robust development process should include checks for hardcoded secrets before any code is committed. Furthermore, authentication logic should always perform proper validation, even in a development environment, to avoid creating insecure patterns.
